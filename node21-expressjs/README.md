# Node 21 Express

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

To run Express on Unikraft Cloud, first [install the `kraft` CLI tool](https://unikraft.org/docs/cli).
Then clone this examples repository and `cd` into this directory, and invoke:

```console
kraft cloud deploy --metro fra -p 443:3000 -M 256 .
```

The command will deploy the files under `app/`.

After deploying, you can query the service using the provided URL.
